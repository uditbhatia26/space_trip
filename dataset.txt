### General Space Knowledge ###
Q: What is the closest planet to Earth?
A: Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of proximity, but the closest planet varies depending on orbital positions.

Q: How long does it take to travel to Mars?
A: A typical journey to Mars takes about 6-9 months using current propulsion technology.

Q: What is the escape velocity of Earth?
A: Earth's escape velocity is approximately 11.2 km/s.

Q: What are Lagrange Points?
A: Lagrange Points are positions in space where the gravitational forces of two large bodies, such as the Earth and Moon, balance the centripetal force of a smaller object.

### Interplanetary Mission Planning ###
Q: How much fuel is required for a Mars mission?
A: A Mars mission typically requires 500-700 tons of fuel, depending on the payload and propulsion technology.

Q: What is the optimal launch window for a trip to Jupiter?
A: Jupiter transfer windows occur approximately every 13 months when Earth and Jupiter are properly aligned.

Q: How much does it cost to send 1kg of payload to the Moon?
A: The estimated cost to send 1kg to the Moon is around $1.2M using current rocket technology.

Q: What is the travel time to Titan?
A: A mission to Saturn's moon Titan typically takes 6-7 years using traditional propulsion methods.

### Edge Cases and Anomaly Handling ###
Q: What happens if a spacecraft runs out of fuel mid-mission?
A: The spacecraft will either drift in space or require assistance from onboard ion thrusters or gravity assist maneuvers.

Q: How does radiation affect astronauts on long missions?
A: Prolonged exposure to cosmic radiation increases the risk of cancer and neurological damage; radiation shielding is crucial.

Q: What if communication with the spacecraft is lost?
A: Most spacecraft are programmed with an autonomous recovery mode to re-establish contact.
